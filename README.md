## Development server
After installing all your npm dependencies with `npm install` (ensure you're using an updated version of node):

Run `ng serve` for a client dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `npm run start:server` for the backend server.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
